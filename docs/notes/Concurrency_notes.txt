implements  Runnable/extends Thread
Interrupts -
Thread.interrupted() - true if interruped being recieved
if (Thread.interrupted()) {
    throw new InterruptedException();
    interrupt status flag -
    Thread.interrupt sets this flag
    Check Thread.interrupted, interrupt status is cleared.

    isInterrupted  - does not clear


The join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing,
t.join(); =
causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates
Like sleep, join responds to an interrupt by exiting with an InterruptedException

Synchronization -
Memory Consistency Errors
Intrinsic Locks/monitor lock.
Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it
a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock
When a thread releases an intrinsic lock, a happens-before relationship is established

When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock
Another way to create synchronized code is with synchronized statements
    synchronized(this)
