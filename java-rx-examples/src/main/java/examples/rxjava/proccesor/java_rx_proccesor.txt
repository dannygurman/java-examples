Processor
It represents a processing stageâ€”which is both a Subscriber and a Publisher
and obeys the contracts of both.

public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<R> {}

In the Reactive-Streams specification, the Subject-like behavior,
namely being a consumer and supplier of events at the same time,   is done by the Processor interface.

The Processors  available in RxJava:

Publish Processor(Subject in RxJava1)
Replay Processor
Behavior Processor
Async Processor

Processor acts both as an observer and as an Observable.

Because it is an observer, it can subscribe to one or more Observables, and because it is an Observable,
 it can pass through the items it observes by re-emitting them, and it can also emit new items.
