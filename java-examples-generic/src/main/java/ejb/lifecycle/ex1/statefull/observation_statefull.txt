Observations

Since a Servlet itself is not thread safe, multiple threads will in fact enter the doGet() method

A single instance of the SFSB (evident via the hashCode result) in being accessed
concurrently (see the thread names in the logged statements)

Only one thread will be able to access the SFSB instance though !–
 other threads wait for their turn while the SFSB method returns.

  This delay is noticeable via the log statements on the console
