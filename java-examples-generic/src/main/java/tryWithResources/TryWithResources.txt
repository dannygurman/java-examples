//The Java try with resources construct, AKA Java try-with-resources, is an exception handling mechanism that
makes it possible to automatically close resources like an InputStream or a JDBC Connection when you are done with them.

 To do so, you must open and use the resource within a Java try-with-resources block.
When the execution leaves the try-with-resources block, any resource opened within
the try-with-resources block is automatically closed,
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown either from inside the try-with-resources block,
or when attempting to close the resources.

   //InputStream implements Closeable
       // FileInputStream extends InputStream
       // public interface Closeable extends AutoCloseable {

       //Closeable extends AutoCloseable, and is specifically dedicated to IO streams:
        //it throws IOException instead of Exception, and is idempotent,
        whereas AutoCloseable doesn't provide this guarantee.
       }
