Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical lead
(TL), product manager (PM). There can be multiple employees, but only one TL or PM.
An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free. If a fresher
canâ€™t handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to technical lead. If the TL is
not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to PM. Design the
classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method getCallHandler().


All three ranks of employees have different work to be done, so those specific functions are
profile specific.
We should keep these specific things within their respective class.

There are a few things which are common to them, like address, name, job title, age, etc.
These things can be kept in one class and can be extended / inherited by others.

Finally, there should be one CallHandler class which would route the calls to the concerned
person.
