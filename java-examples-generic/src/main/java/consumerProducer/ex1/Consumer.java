//This is  a simple class that reads the Integer and prints it on the console.
// However, key points to note are:

// 1. The loop to process data is an endless loop, that runs on two conditions â€“
// until the producer is producing and there is some data with the broker

//2. Again, the Thread.sleep is used to create effective and different scenarios
