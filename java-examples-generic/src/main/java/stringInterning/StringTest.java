/**
 * Because strings are usually plentiful in most applications, Java goes to great lengths to make sure strings perform well.
 * First, strings are immutable, so they don't have to be thread-safe. Because synchronization is expensive, strings are spared that drag on performance.
 *
 * Second, as you might guess, strings specified at compile-time are flyweightsâ€”strings that contain the same character sequence are shared.
 *
 * That sharing can greatly reduce memory footprints, and therefore, increase performance.
