public String intern()
Returns a canonical representation for the string object.

A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the class String.

When the intern method is invoked,
if the pool already contains a string equal to this String object as determined by the equals(Object) method,
then the string from the pool is returned.

Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String object is returned.

It follows that for any two strings s and t, s.intern() == t.intern() is true if and only if s.equals(t) is true.

All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are interned.
 String literals are defined in section 3.10.5 of the The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification.

Returns:
a string that has the same contents as this string, but is guaranteed to be from a pool of unique strings.
