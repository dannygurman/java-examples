//We need to make sure all the concrete classes that implement Quackable can handle being a QuackObservable.
//We could approach this by implementing registration and notification in each and every class (like we did in previous example) 
//But we are going to do it a little differently this time:
//We are going to encapsulate the registration and notification code in another class, call it Observable, and compose it with a QuackObservable.
//That way we only write the real code once and the QuackObservable just needs enough code to delegate to the helper class Observable.

//Observable implements all the functionality a Quackable needs to be an observable. 
//We just need to plug it into a class and have that class delegate to Observable.

	//	this object along so that the observer knows which object is quacking.
