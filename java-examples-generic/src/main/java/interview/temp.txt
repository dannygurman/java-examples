B) SQL
Define a schema to describe a university where there asre courses, students and students get grades in courses - describe PK, FK.

Then write a query to print course name and average grade.

Answer: Assuming the table structure is (Courses - Id, Name : Students - Id, Name : Grades: Student_ID, Course_ID, grade)

the query is:
select c.name, avg(grades.grade) from
courses c join on c.id =  grades.course_id
group by course.name

I ask also give all the courses for averages greater than 90. The addition to the query should be "having avg(grades.grade) > 90"

C. Design
Give an Engine which runsTasks which are classes that implement Task interface (void doWork(Object[] parameters)).
 You get a class you need to add to the engine "C" but it has only "void doSomething()".
How will you add it to the engine?

Answer:
The design pattern is a decorator/wrapper.
Write class CWrapper implements Task.
Instanciate  C in the ctor.
in doWork(Object[] params) call .doSomething().

Usually these 3 questions take ~1 - 1.5 hrs.
