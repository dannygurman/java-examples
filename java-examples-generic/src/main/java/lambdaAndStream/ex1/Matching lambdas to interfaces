A single method interface is also sometimes referred to as a functional interface.

Matching a Java lambda expression against a functional interface is divided into these steps:

Does the interface have only one method?
Does the parameters of the lambda expression match the parameters of the single method?
Does the return type of the lambda expression match the return type of the single method?
If the answer is yes to these three questions, then the given lambda expression
 is matched successfully against the interface.
