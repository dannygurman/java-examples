Before we look deeper into using the Stream.reduce() operation, let's break down the operation's
 participant elements into separate blocks.
  That way, we'll understand more easily the role that each one plays:

Identity – an element that is the initial value of the reduction
 operation and the default result if the stream is empty

Accumulator – a function that takes two parameters: a partial result of the reduction operation
and the next element of the stream

Combiner – a function used to combine the partial result of the reduction operation
when the reduction is parallelized,
or when there's a mismatch between the types of the accumulator arguments
 and the types of the accumulator implementation
