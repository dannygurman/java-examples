he CompletableFuture.get() method is blocking.
It waits until the Future is completed and returns the result after its completion.

But, that’s not what we want right? For building asynchronous systems we should be able to attach a callback to the CompletableFuture
which should automatically get called when the Future completes.

That way, we won’t need to wait for the result, and we can write the logic that needs to be executed after
 the completion of the Future inside our callback function.

You can attach a callback to the CompletableFuture using thenApply(), thenAccept() and thenRun() methods -
