Causes of Starvation in Java
The following three common causes can lead to starvation of threads in Java:

Threads with high priority swallow all CPU time from threads with lower priority.

Threads are blocked indefinately waiting to enter a synchronized block,
because other threads are constantly allowed access before it.

Threads waiting on an object (called wait() on it) remain waiting indefinitely
because other threads are constantly awakened instead of it
